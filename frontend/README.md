# 🚀 Hipster-Tools Frontend - A Magical Blend of NestJS & VueJS 🧙‍♂️

Welcome to the frontend of Hipster-Tools, a web app brewed with NestJS and VueJS. It's a mystical tool for all your Tabletop RPG adventures. This project has been conjured from the essence of a boilerplate, and it's ready to roll the dice!

## 🎲 Vue 3 Boilerplate - Vite, Pinia, Vue Router & Tailwind CSS 🎩

This boilerplate is a result of a magical incantation found in my [custom Vue 3 boilerplate tutorial](https://medium.com/@richardevcom/custom-vue3-boilerplate-9635806acde3). It's a spell to get you started with Vue 3 in Vite. The template uses Vue 3 `<script setup>` SFCs, check out the [script setup docs](https://v3.vuejs.org/api/sfc-script-setup.html#sfc-script-setup) to learn more.
